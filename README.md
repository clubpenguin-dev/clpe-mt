# clpe-mt
hey this is a multitool i made for myself you can use it also


how to make it runable via the command "clpemt" this only works on linux and it works on all distros

first do this, this just moves it to /usr/local/bin/clpemt

```sudo mv multitool.sh /usr/local/bin/clpemt```
this makes it executable


```sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/clpemt```
